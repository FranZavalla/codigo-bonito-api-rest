# Testing talk 2023

This repo stores the code used for [a talk about testing in a python](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/buenos-aires-python-meetup/events/293425518/) event in my city. I will also use them as teaching material for a Software Engineer class at [FaMAF](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/).

Here is the [slides of the talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DeXQj5orCryapAgO2kH1A8D6Dzx-KBmhQz648t6ww64/edit?usp=sharing)
